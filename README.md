# Calculator 

This is my calculator project. It is for the most part responsive. I don't have a 4k monitor to test on for anything larger than 1440px width so 1440 is the limit for now.

## Stuff I learned

So far my challenge has been accessibility and making the site responsive. I had to refresh my knowledge on media queries and now the site is responsive.
