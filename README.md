# Calculator 

This is my calculator project. It is for the most part responsive. I don't have a 4k monitor to test on for anything larger than 1440px width so 1440 is the limit for now.

## Stuff I learned

- Responsive design: The first problem I ran into was accessibility and making the site responsive. I had to refresh my knowledge on media queries and now the site is responsive.
- Programing logic for conducting operations and calculations
- OOP in JS
